This site is the home of the Idolm@ster: Starlit Season Fan Translation Project.

[*Install Instructions, Buying Instructions, and Frequently Asked Questions can be found here.*](/contents/Info.html)

### Legal Information:

As of currently, this is a UI only preview build of the Starlit Season English Fan Translation Patch.
***This preview build is currently tested to work with version 1.61 of Starlit Season on Steam.***
It is incomplete, and not guaranteed to work on pirated copies. We can only give an estimated timeframe of *"when it's done"*.

***Please*** support the developers by [***buying the game using our buying guide***](/contents/Info.html), and by buying any official localization effort if one happens. Distributing game software through the internet without permission from the rights holder,
or downloading illegally distributed software through the internet is copyright infringement, and we ask you to **not** redistribute *any* of our patches outside of our official sources.

We thank you for your patience and understanding.
